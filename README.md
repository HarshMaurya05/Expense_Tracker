Flutter Expense Tracker

~ I built a simple Expense Tracker app using Flutter. The app helps users keep track of their daily spending.

~ Users can add, update, or delete expenses. Each expense includes a title, amount, category, and date.

~ The total expense amount is automatically calculated and displayed at the top of the screen.

~ Thereâ€™s also a search bar that filters expenses based on the title, making it easy to find specific entries.

~ For state management, I used Riverpod.

~ All the data is stored and managed through a MockAPI backend, and I used the http package to connect my app to the API (for fetch, post, put, and delete operations).

~ The UI is clean and responsive, with a dark theme to make it look modern and user-friendly.
